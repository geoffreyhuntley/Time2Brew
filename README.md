# Time2Brew
Xamarin app for brew day.

Using ReactiveUI

This app will walk a user through a brew day.  Given a few basic pieces
of information the app will calculate things like the amount of water needed
for strike and sparge as well as it's temperature.  In addition it will have
times to notify the user of hop additions and when the mash and boil are done.
